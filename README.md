# 📄 Page Replacement Algorithms Simulator

A simple educational web application built for the **SPOS (System Programming and Operating Systems)** subject.  
This project helps students **understand, visualize, and simulate page replacement algorithms** used in operating systems when a **page fault** occurs and the required page must be fetched from **secondary memory**.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

When a page fault occurs, the operating system must decide **which page to replace** in main memory.  
This website provides a **simulator-based learning approach** to understand how different page replacement algorithms work in real time.

---

## 🧠 Algorithms Covered

The simulator teaches the following **page replacement algorithms**:

- **FCFS (First Come First Serve)**
- **OPR (Optimal Page Replacement)**
- **LRU (Least Recently Used)**
- **MRU (Most Recently Used)**

Each algorithm is explained clearly and demonstrated through simulation.

## ⚙️ Features

- 📘 Learn the theory behind page replacement algorithms
- 🧪 Interactive simulator to test algorithms
- 🧠 Visual understanding of page faults and replacements
- 🔄 Step-by-step page replacement process
- 🎓 Designed specifically for **SPOS academic learning**

---

## 🖥️ Simulator

Using the simulator, users can:
- Enter page reference strings
- Select a page replacement algorithm
- Define the number of frames
- Observe:
  - Page hits
  - Page faults
  - Page replacement behavior

This makes learning **hands-on and intuitive**.
